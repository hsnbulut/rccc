# Simulation Example (Sample)

This folder provides a **representative simulation example** consistent with the framework used in the manuscript.

- A single design (Design A) is included as an example.
- Three scenarios are illustrated:
  1) clean data,
  2) unidirectional contamination,
  3) bidirectional contamination.

- The script computes RMSE for each agreement/concordance coefficient **with respect to the true population correlation (ρ)**, consistent with the evaluation criterion used in the manuscript.


The full simulation study in the paper includes additional designs (B–E), larger grids of (n, ρ, contamination rate), and extensive repetitions; therefore, only a sample scenario is provided here for demonstration and reproducibility.
