# rccc: robust concordance correlation coefficent

This repository provides reproducibility materials for the manuscript:

**A High-Breakdown MCD-Based Robust Concordance Correlation Coefficient**

The code included here allows full reproduction of the real-data analyses reported in the paper.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Repository Structure

-   `R/`\
    R functions implementing classical and robust concordance correlation coefficients\
    (CCC, rCCC, L1-CCC, Bayesian CCC, and related robust variants).

-   `real_data/`\
    Scripts for real-data applications used in the manuscript\
    (glucose and blood pressure examples).

-   `scripts/`\
    Helper scripts for running all analyses in a single step and printing session information.

-   `results/`\
    Output tables generated by the real-data scripts (CSV format).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Requirements

-   R version \>= 4.2.0\

-   Required R packages include (but may not be limited to):

    -   robustbase

    <!-- -->

    -   MASS
    -   rrcov
    -   MethComp
    -   L1pack
    -   mvtnorm
    -   coda
    -   dplyr
    -   tidyr

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to Run

1.  Clone or download this repository.
2.  Open R or RStudio.
3.  Set the working directory to the repository root (`rccc`).
4.  Run the following command:

``` r
source("scripts/run_real_data_examples.R")
```

This command will:

Load all required functions from the R/ directory,

Execute all real-data analysis scripts in real_data/,

Print summary tables to the R console,

Save result tables as CSV files under the results/ directory.

## Outputs 

Running the scripts produces: Console output summarizing clean and contaminated concordance estimates, CSV files containing the corresponding result tables saved in results/.

## Reproducibility Note

Due to the extensive and highly modular nature of the simulation framework (multiple designs, contamination scenarios, and large-scale repetitions), the full simulation engine is not included in this repository.

However, all real-data analyses reported in the manuscript are fully reproducible using the code provided here. The simulation results presented in the paper were generated using the same core functions included in this repository.
